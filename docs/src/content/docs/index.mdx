## What's a zurabot?

## Features

### <Icon name="rocket" /> Automating tasks

Zurabot simplifies automation by handling common tasks for you and your team. Say goodbye to spending excessive time tinkering with tooling and hello to focusing on your applications.

### <Icon name="approve-check-circle" /> Strict safety & checks

Gone are the days of manually configuring file glob patterns for Workspace integrity and decision making for whether or not checks and tasks must run. oneRepo automatically and accurately determines which Workspaces, tasks, and checks are necessary for any given change

### <Icon name="puzzle" /> Stop recompiling dependencies

With oneRepo, you can utilize shared Workspaces as source-level dependencies. This means that all import/require chains within the monorepo originate from the source files, eliminating the need to rebuild shared packages to capture changes.

### <Icon name="list-format" /> Human-readable output

Logging output from every command and tool in oneRepo is carefully grouped, documented, and prevented from overlapping parallel executions. Every line includes context, timing, and log-type information.

        <TabItem label="npm">

        	```sh title="Install via npm"
        	npx --package=onerepo one install
        	```

        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="yarn">

        	```sh title="Install via Yarn"
        	yarn dlx --package=onerepo one install
        	```

        </TabItem>

        <TabItem label="pnpm">

        	```sh title="Install via pnpm"
        	pnpm --package=onerepo dlx one install
        	```

        </TabItem>

    </Tabs>

1.  **Create your oneRepo**
    Next, use the `one create` command to initialize into an existing or a new repository.

    ```sh title="Initialize oneRepo in a new or existing repository"
    one create
    ```
